I am the founder of [JuliaEarth](https://github.com/JuliaEarth), an organization that maintains top-quality
open source software for geostatistics and other specialized branches of statistics that are very relevant
in the Earth sciences.

To fund this work I have chosen to rely on the direct support of the community. Having an additional incentive in the form of recurrent donations would be highly appreciated. I plan to use the money to create more educational material and for marketing purposes.

Any support is welcome ❤️
